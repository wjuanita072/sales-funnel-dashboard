# 🔍 Sales Funnel Quota Project – 120% Attainment (Excel + CSV)

This is a personal sales analysis project where I used raw CRM-style lead data to optimize my sales funnel and close rate. The dashboard and analysis helped me exceed quota — hitting **120%** with a **60% close rate** from qualified leads. This project demonstrates my ability to clean data, build insightful dashboards, and use performance metrics to drive real results.

## 📁 Project Overview

Using 2 dataset of 50 outbound leads, I identified trends in objections, lead sources, and conversion speed to increase efficiency and maximize output. I created dashboards to analyze team performance, optimize my own process, and ultimately **exceed my personal quota.**

This project highlights how I use data to:
- Visualize the full sales funnel
- Track rep performance (including my own)
- Identify where conversions were breaking down
- Make smart outreach decisions
- Hit and exceed sales goals
